# eye_defect_detection

A Flutter app for detecting diabetic retinopathy stages using a custom trained TensorFlow Lite model.

---

## Getting Started

This Flutter project includes user authentication, image classification into 5 diabetic retinopathy stages, history tracking, and result display.

- The entire app logic is in `lib/main.dart` â€” login, registration, homepage, results, about, contact, logout.
- The TFLite model is located at `assets/model.tflite`.
- Dependencies and assets are defined in `pubspec.yaml`.

## About

The app detects 5 stages of diabetic retinopathy:

- No DR  
- Mild DR  
- Moderate DR  
- Severe DR  
- Proliferative DR

The model was trained by us and converted to TensorFlow Lite for on-device inference.
